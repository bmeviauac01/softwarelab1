No. This course is 3 credits, which (officially) translates to approx. 90 hours of work invested throughout the semester. The lab is not just the 4 hours you spend with the instructor; it also involves preliminary preparation and finishing/completing the tasks at home.</p> <p>My code contains a small typo, and I received no grade. You are expected to write code that works! You are completing the exercises in front of a computer, so you have everything you need to check yourself. Your code must compile and must run.

Talk to your lab instructor.</p> <p>The instructor does not help. Why? You might not be given the right solution if you face a problem. But this does not mean you get no help.

In short: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask. In more detail: If you are stuck, first, make an effort to understand your problem.

No. Everything you need here, you should already know. Google is an excellent tool, and StackOverflow is even better. However... You also need to understand the answer you find here.

These steps do not correspond to your exercises; these describe the evaluation process. These steps include preparations, such as setting up the .NET environment for compiling your code (since each workflow starts in a clean environment, these steps are performed each time).</p> <p>Most of these steps should be successful, even if your submission contains an error. The two exceptions when these tasks might fail due to your changes are: (1) if <code>neptun.txt</code> is missing, or (2) your C# code does not compile. The <code>neptun.txt</code> is mandatory, and no evaluation is performed until that is provided. The C# compilation is a step that must succeed; otherwise, your application cannot be started.</p> <p>There might be transient errors in these workflows. An example is when a download, such as the download of the .NET environment fails. The workflow execution can be repeated if this occurs. Retrying the execution may only help if the problem is indeed transient; a retry will not resolve a C# compilation error.

In this response, the status code will be 400, and there will also be a body, which follows the format of the Problem Details RFC standard.

The Clustered Index Scan would be too costly in a large table. The NonClustered Index can reduce the number of records, hence its role here. Based on the statistics of the <code>Price</code> column, it can be derived that the <code>=</code> operator will match few records. Important!
